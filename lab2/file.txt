His removal leaves the seat vacant, temporarily tightening the already-slim Republican majority in the House and giving Democrats two opportunities to flip the battleground Third District in 2024. 
The first opportunity will be a special election to fill the seat through January 2025. New York Governor Kathy Hochul must announce the date of the special election within ten days, and the election must take place 70 to 80 days after that. Instead of holding typical primaries, county party leaders will choose the candidates for the special election. The winner of that race will finish Santosâ€™ term.
